# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project applies the K-Means clustering algorithm to segment mall customers based on their **Annual Income** and **Spending Score**. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups to help businesses target marketing strategies more effectively.

## 📊 Project Overview

- **Dataset:** [Mall_Customers.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python)
- **Clustering Algorithm:** K-Means (Unsupervised Learning)
- **Features Used:**
  - Annual Income (k$)
  - Spending Score (1–100)

## 📌 Objectives

- Visualize customer distribution based on income and spending.
- Apply the **Elbow Method** to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- Train and fit the K-Means model.
- Interpret and visualize the resulting customer segments.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📉 Results & Visualization

The analysis revealed five distinct customer segments, each with unique income and spending behavior. These groups are visualized using colored scatter plots, with cluster centroids highlighted.
